# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied to components. The issue appears randomly and affects only some classes, while others are applied correctly.

## Bug Description

The problem involves inconsistencies in Tailwind's class application.  Sometimes the specified classes are applied without issue; other times, some or all of the classes are ignored, resulting in unexpected styling. This behavior is not consistent and seems random.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

Observe the styling of the button element. In some instances, the button will have the expected styling (red background, blue hover, white text etc); in other instances the classes are not applied, leading to different or default styling.

## Potential Causes

* **Caching Issues:** Problems with caching of Tailwind's output CSS files. This often manifests as stale files not reflecting the latest changes.  Clearing the browser cache or restarting the development server might resolve this. 
* **Conflicting Styles:**  Other CSS rules could be overriding the Tailwind classes. Thoroughly check for any potential conflicts.
* **Build Process Errors:** Errors in the build process might prevent the proper compilation or integration of the Tailwind styles.
* **Incorrect Purge Configuration:** If using PurgeCSS, misconfigurations in the purge options may result in classes being removed unexpectedly.
