// Solution: Ensure Tailwind directives are correctly configured and check for conflicting styles.
// 1. Verify your Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js` to ensure it correctly points to your CSS file and includes the necessary directives, especially `content` for PurgeCSS. 
// 2. Check your CSS for any overriding styles that might conflict with your Tailwind classes.
// 3. Restart the development server. Clearing browser cache can also help to ensure no stale CSS files remain. 
// 4. If using PurgeCSS, carefully review your purge configuration to make sure that the classes you need are not accidentally being removed.
// 5. Consider adding a more verbose logging mechanism to trace the order of CSS application, possibly with browser dev tools to inspect exactly how styles are being overridden.
// Example of addressing potential purge issues:
// tailwind.config.js:
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
